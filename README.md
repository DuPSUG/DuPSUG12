# DuPSUG12
DuPSUG 12 – Visit from AWS

At the Dutch PowerShell User Group we now have the chance to host people from AWS. These are the ones that are responsible for the PowerShell and .NET stuff, so be prepared for some good content and to send them your feedback!

## About DuPSUG 12
This is an afternoon/evening edition of our user group. This means we will start off with a quick bite to eat for our attendees and speakers. We have an evening with diverse and advanced topics prepared for you presented by experienced speakers. If you would like to attend please register through Eventbrite to reserve your seat, as we have limited seats available.
